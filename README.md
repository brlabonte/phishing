# Phishing
BFOR519 Final Project - Phishing Simulation

## Project Overview 
The subject I chose to work on for this project is phishing. I used a real world example of the phishing tests that we conduct as an IT team for the company I work at, and on top of that, I created my own phishing test and sent it to close friends and family with their consent which I got several weeks ago. Simulated phishing tests are conducted within organizations to ensure that employees remain vigilant and are careful of what links they click, what files they download, and what information they give out.
